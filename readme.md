# About me
Workinfg as Technical asst. at IIIT Bhubaneswar since september 2011.Takes  differents types of Electronics lab such as Analog Electronic,Digital Electronic,Analog Comm.,Digital comm,Digital signal processing. My hubby is to design different types of electronics circuit .
# Umesh swain first experience at STPI BHUBANESWAR on dt 18/03/2019.
Joined fabzero programme on dt 18/3/2019 at stpi bhubaneswar.
At first some intoduction about fabzero lab at 11.30am .
We visited the fav lab. and seen differnt types of machines like CNC,band saw,scroll saw,laser cutter,3D printer,inkjet printer,sterioleothography printer.
CNC machine is used in the manufacturing sector that involves the use of computer to control machine tools.
Band saw has a sharp blade consisting of a continuous band of toothed metal stretched between two or metal wheel to cut material.
Scroll saw used to cut intricate curved in wood or other material.

Down load the visual studio code and install it.
Spell check code install sucessfully.
Open the visual studio code and write the documentation sucessfully and check the spell using spell check coder.
Git software install sucessfully.
Able to upload image using visual studio code.
Inkspace and cura software download and install sucessfully.
Frank explain about vinyl cutter .
How to roll keep in side the cutter and how to operate the cutter? Then all the trainers are try to set up the roll.
## Open the inkspace  softeare .
Click on the file and open the new file write my name using inkspace software.
After sucessfully write my name the go to google side and open fabmodule.org.
Go to image(.png) click output former click ronald vinyl(.camm) click process then velocity 20 then calculate the save in mi document file.After save took the svae file using pendrive and load in frank laptop which already connected with vinyl cutter machine and complete my project file. 
Install the Kicad software successfully.
Seen different objects which are used for PCB design machine(monoFab).
Web camera,vernier caliper,cupper board,scacrificial board,double side tape,3D scaner(which has a sensor and two camera),globes,cleaner,brush,scissor,fire blanket(which made in borax materials)
Open the kicad software.
Create a new project: File - New - Project. Name the project file .
Begin by creating a schematic. Start the schematic editor Eeschema.
We will now place our first component.
Click on the middle of  schematic . A  Symbol window will appear on the screen. We’re going to place a resistor. Search / filter on the 'R' of Resistor. 
Right click in the middle of the component and select Properties → Edit Value.
The Edit Value  window will appear. Replace the current value 'R' with value. Click OK.
In case any mistake and want to delete a component, right click on the component and click 'Delete'.
Right click on the second resistor. Select 'Drag'. Left click to drop. 
Repeat the add-component , select the 'microchip_attiny 45'.
Repeat the add-component , picking the 'LED' component from it.
Place the power and ground symbols. Click on the 'Place power port' button.
Repeat the add-pin  select the GND part.
